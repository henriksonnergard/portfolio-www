          <h4>Project description</h4>
          <p>I think what fundamentally drives my creativity is mixing different media. What happens when you combine text with music or video with spoken voice? What can you add or subtract from an experience to change the feeling? This is what I love to explore through filming and making videos.</p>
          <p>When I invested in a new DSLR camera a few years back it came with built-in video recording. Over time this feature grew on me, and I went from recording short clips to try my hand at actually scripting stories and editing. This has resulted in a few rather odd short films.</p>

            <figcaption>"Eiffeltornet del 9" is a short where I tried to explore what the result would be if I recorded a made-up documentary about "nothing", talking more or less gibberish, and added sad, calming piano music on top.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>"Fragile Movements" is one of my first short films, where I wanted to create a purely aesthetic experience, where the slow movement of different liquids matches with the music.</figcaption>
