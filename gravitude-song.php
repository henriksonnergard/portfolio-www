          <h4>Project description</h4>
          <p>Somewhere at the beginning of this millenium, a friend of mine bought a snowboard game called SSX Tricky, which we played extensively every time I went to visit him. But it was the sequel, SSX3, that I completely fell in love with. This was my go-to game for years, and still is.</p>
          <p>When the reboot of the SSX franchise was announced in 2011, and it revealed that it would be possible to import your own music into the game, I couldn't resist to get creative. The short, 3 minute piece I composed was made with the game's menu, called RiderNet, in mind, something to listen to as you choose your next slope to shred down.</p>
