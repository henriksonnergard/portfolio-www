          <h4>Project description</h4>
          <p>The very first website I put online at a young age, back in 2006 in fact, was for my music project Warpfuz. As my design skills and understanding of HTML and CSS grew, so did this website. A solution I stuck with very long, though, was to have the actual site as a static frame while loading content in via iframe. Hey, coming from table designs it was a revolution!</p>
          <p>But you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand that this site looked pretty weird on Google searches. So, a new site design had to be made. At this time I had just learned about HTML5, so this was the first time I got to actually use it.</p>
          <p>Moving away from the pixel perfect designs I was used to, this one was made with simplicity and accessability in mind. The navigation moved to the left, fixed so it stays when you scroll down. The content area have very basic styling, as does the footer area. Color scheme is very sharp, with mainly grey shades and a clear lime green hue on log and page headings.<p>
