          <h4>Project description</h4>
          <p>For a few years I've been working as a consultant for JT Tech, a small Swedish business focusing on telecom. I've mostly been involved in internal design projects, everything from the corporate identity including logotype and style guides to more specific projects like the company website, product brochures and advertising.</p>
          <p>One of the first projects was a website for a client, complete with e-shop functionality. On this project I was in charge of layout, design and graphic, shaping most of the visual appearance. This was also my first experience working with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, a CMS I've used on other projects since then.</p>
